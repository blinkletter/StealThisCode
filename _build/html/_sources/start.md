# Steal This Code

I want to introduce you to the **power** of using computers to analyze and visualize data. Spreadsheets are great for budgeting but they are difficult to use when data gets "big." And **big data** is here to stay. **Biology** and **chemistry** are rapidly becoming data-intensive fields. The tools to command all this data reside in specialized tools like "***R***" and general-purpose languages like ***Python***.

Most science students have never really commanded a computer. Apps command you, not the other way around. Learning to **interpret and adapt** a computer program for your own purposes is an essential skill in science. 

The goal of this course is to introduce students to **biochemistry**, not computer science. I will not be teaching **programming**. We will use programs that have been written and adapt them as needed. Along the way the basics of commanding a computer with written instructions will be revealed to you.

## Programming as Theft

We will use *Python* only as a **tool**. All code will be written for you in the first set of exercises. You will need only change a few values to adapt the code to your needs. Once you have experienced changing and **reusing** code that was written for you you will be asked to **steal** it and **adapt** it to solve the final problems in this course. You will never need to change much, but will hopefully gain the ability to find useful code, steal it and **use it**. Steal it from me; steal it from the internet; give your code to friends. Always **give credit** where credit is due.

## Things to Steal

**All the code** that you will need in the first half of our exercises will be **available** in the information pages for the lab or tutorial in question. This book is intended to provide some basic **examples** of *Python* code for performing **calculations and visualizing data**. You will see that the programs that you are using during our tutorials we all stolen from this book and changed to suit you. Examine, play with, and **steal the code** in the interactive notebooks linked below.

### Math and Calculations

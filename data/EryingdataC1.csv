# From Table 2 in the paper
#
# k is the "fluxional rate constant" for interchange between the bidentate forms
# of the complex. See figure 3 for the experiment. Rate constant is in units of s^-1
#
# Given the nature of the experiment (fitting simulated spectra against data to
# determine exchange rates between the two identical bidentate forms) I would 
# estimate a large error in these results. No standard deviations are reported.
